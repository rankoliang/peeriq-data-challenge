# PeerIQ Data Challenge

## Getting Started

These instructions will assume you are using a unix based OS and have python
installed on your system.
If this is your first time running this, create a virutal environment using
```
python3 -m venv venv
```
Then, activate your virutal environment by running
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
Finally, install the python dependencies using
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Tests

To run the test suite, run
```
python3 -m pytest
```
